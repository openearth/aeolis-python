# Contributing guidelines

Any kind of contribution to AeoLiS is welcome, from a simple comment or a question, to a full fledged [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). 

A contribution can be associated with the following cases:

- You have a question.
- You think you may have found a bug, including unexpected behavior.
- You want to make changes to the code base to fix a bug, make improvements, add a new functionality, or to update the documentation.

The sections below outlines the steps to make your contribution to the software for each of the aforementioned cases.

## You have a question

1. Use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/openearth/aeolis-python/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue.
1. If your issue search did not yield any relevant results, open a new issue.
1. Apply the "Question" label. Additionally, apply other labels when relevant.

## You think you may have found a bug

1. Use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/openearth/aeolis-python/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue.
1. If your issue search did not yield any relevant results, open a new issue and provide enough information to understand the cause and the context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may also want to include:
    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem
    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using
    - information about the operating system

## You want to make changes to the code base

### Announce your plan

1. (**important**) Announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue on the Github repository.
2. (**important**) Wait until a consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea.


### Set up a local development environment to work on your changes

If you are a part of the AeoLiS team and have write access to the aeolis-python GitHub repository, skip to the next subsection [Develop your contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md#develop-your-contribution). If you are a first-time contributor, follow the below steps:

1. Go to the [aeolis-python GitHub repository](https://github.com/openearth/aeolis-python) and click on 'Fork'. This will create a copy of the aeolis-python repository in your GitHub account. 
            
1. Clone the project to your local computer:
        
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aeolis-python.git
    ```

1. Change the directory

    ```bash
    cd aeolis-python
    ```

1. Add the upstream repository

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/openearth/aeolis-python.git
    ```  

1. Now, git remote -v will show two remote repositories named:

    * `upstream`, which refers to the aeolis-python repository 
    * `origin`, which refers to your personal fork

### Develop your contribution

1. Create a branch off the latest commit on the `main` branch to work on your feature.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```  

2. If you are contributing via a fork, make sure to pull in changes from the 'upstream' repository to stay up to date with the `main` branch while working on your feature branch. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

3. Set up a development environment on your computer by installing the AeoLiS in development mode with the following command: (Consider using a virtual environment for this purpose.)

    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
    
4. Set up your code editor to follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (remove trailing white space, no tabs, etc.). Check code with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).

5. Make sure the existing tests pass by running `pytest` from the root of the repository. 

6. Write tests for any new lines of code you add. 

7. Include in-code documentation in form of comments and docstrings. Update the user documentation if relevant. Use the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) documentation style.

### Submitting your contribution

1. Push your feature branch to (your fork of) the aeolis-python GitHub repository.

1. Create a pull request, for an example, following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

In case you feel you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation; don't let this discourage you from making the pull request. We can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request. But keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.
