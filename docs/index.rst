Welcome to AeoLiS's documentation!
==================================

AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment
transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important,
like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported
are soil moisture contents, sediment sorting and armouring, bed slope
effects, air humidity and roughness elements.

This documentation describes the Python implementation of the AeoLiS
model. The source code of the Python implementation can be found at
`<https://github.com/openearth/aeolis-python>`_.
