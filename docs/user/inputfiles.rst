Input files
=================

The computational grid and boundary conditions for AeoLiS are specified through external
input files called by the model parameter file aeolis.txt.  The computational grid is defined
with an x grid, y grid, and z grid.  Boundary conditions for wind, wave, and tides
are also specified with external text files.  A list of additional grid and boundary
files can be found in the table below.  Each file is further defined below.

aeolis.txt
----------

This is the parameter file for AeoLiS that defines the model processes and boundary conditions.
Parameters in the file are specified by various keywords; each keyword has a pre-defined
default value that will be used if it is not direclty specified in aeolis.txt (a list of default parameter
values can be found in the Default settings tab on the left).  Among the keywords
in aeolis.txt are the keywords to define the external computational grid files (xgrid_file, ygrid_file,
and bed_file) and external boundary condition files (tide_file, wave_file, wind_file, etc.).  
The different physical processes in AeoLiS can be turned on and off by changing the 
process keywords in aeolis.txt to T (True) and F (False).  Example aeolis.txt parameters files can be
found in the examples folder on the AeoLiS GitHub.

x.grd
-----

The x.grd file defines the computational grid in the cross-shore direction defined in meters.  
In a 1-dimensional (1D) case, the file contains a single column of cross-shore locations 
starting at zero for a location of choice.  In a 2-dimesional (2D) case, the file
contains multiple columns (cross-shore positions) and rows (alongshore positions) 
where each value corresponds to a specific location in the 2D grid.  The file can be renamed 
and is referenced from the parameters file with the xgrid_file keyword.

y.grd
-----

This file defines the computational grid in the alongshore direction.  In a 1D case,
y.grd will contain a single column of zeros.  In a 2D case, similar to the x.grd file, 
y.grd has multiple columns (cross-shore positions) and rows (alongshore positions)
where each row, column position corresponds to a specific location in the 2D gird.
x.grd and y.grd will always be the same size regardless of running a 1D or 2D simulation.
As with the x.grd file, this file can be renamed and is referenced from the parameters file with the
keyword: ygrid_file.    

z.grd
-----

The z.grd file provides the model with the elevation information for the computational 
grid defined in x.grd and y.grd.  Similar to x.grd and y.grd, when running 
AeoLis in 1D the file contains a single column with the number of rows equal 
to the number of rows in x.grd and y.grd.  In 2D cases, z.grd has multiple columns and 
rows of equal size to x.grd and y.grd.  Elevation values in the file should be defined such that
positive is up and negative is down.  The file can be renamed and is referenced from the 
parameters file with the keyword: bed_file.

veg.grd
-------

The veg.grd file is an optional grid providing initial vegetation coverage (density) at each position in the 
model domain defined in x.grd and y.grd.  Similar to the grid files, if simulations are in 
2D there will be multiple columns for each cross-shore position (x) and multiple rows for 
each alongshore position (y).  The format of a 1D vegetation grid file can be seen below 
where each red dots represent vegetation cover at each cross-shore position.

   :width: 200px
   :align: center
   
   File format for a 1D AeoLis vegetation grid.  Each red dot is the vegetation density at a specific location in the computational grid.

mass.txt
--------

The mass.txt file allows users to specify variations in grain size distribution in both 
horizontal and vertical directions.  If the grain size distribution is constant throughout
the model domain, multifraction sediment transport is possilbe without this file.  The file contains
the mass of each sediment fraction in each grid cell and bed layer. The file is formatted such that each
row corresponds to a specific location in the computational domain and the columns are grouped 
by bed layers and each individual column represents a single sediment fraction present in the model
domain.  An infinite number of sediment fractions can be defined in the model; however, it should be 
noted the more sediment fractions present the longer the simulation time and larger the output files.    

In a 1D case, the text file will have dimensions of number of cross-shore locations (x) by number 
of sediment fractions times the number of bed layers.  For example if you have 200 cross-shore positions
in your model domain and 4 different sediment fractions with 3 bed layers, your mass.txt file 
will contain a matrix of 200 rows by 12 columns.  An example of a 1D mass.txt file can be seen below 
where each red dot represents a sediment fraction mass at a specific location in the model domain.

   File format for a 1D AeoLis mass for spatially variable grain size distributions.  Each red dot is the mass for each sediment fraction
   at each location in the computational grid (x, y, bed layer).
 
In a 2D case, the mass.txt file will have dimensions of number of cross-shore positions (x)
times the number of alongshore positions (x) by number of sediment fractions times the number of
bed layers.  The file will be formatted such that the columns are grouped by bed layer with all available
sediment fractions present in each bed layer and rows are grouped by alongshore position with all 
cross-shore prositions given for each alongshore position.  An visual example of a 2D mass.txt input
file for AeoLis can be seen below.

   File format for a 2D AeoLis mass file for spatially variable grain size distributions.  Each red dot is the mass for each sediment fraction
   at each location in the computational grid (x, y, bed layer).

wind.txt
--------

The wind.txt file provides the model with wind boundary conditions and is formatted similar to 
the tide.txt and wave.txt files.  The first column is time in seconds from 
start, the second column is wind speed, and the third column is wind direction.  The wind directions
can be specified in either nautical or cartesian convention (specified in aeolis.txt with keyword: wind_convention).  
The format of this file can be seen below were each of the red dots represents a data value of time, wind speed, 
or wind direction.  As AeoLiS is an aeolian sediment transport model, the wind boundary conditions are of particular
importance.

tide.txt
--------

The tide.txt file contains the water elevation data for the duration of the 
simulation.  It is formatted such that the first column is time in seconds and 
the second column is the water elevation data at each time step.  An example of 
the file format can be seen below where each red dot represents a data value for 
time or water elevation.

.. _fig-tide-inputs:

   :alt: tide input format
   :width: 300px

   File format for the water elevation conditions file for AeoLis input.
   
wave.txt
--------

The wave.txt file provides the model with wave data used in AeoLiS for runup calculations.  
The file is formatted similar to tide.txt but has three columns instead of two.  
Here, the first column is time in seconds, the second column is wave height, 
and the third column is the wave period.  The format of this file can be seen 
below where each red dot represents 
a data value. 

.. _fig-wave-inputs:

   :alt: wave input format
   :width: 300px
   :align: center
   
   File format for the wave conditions file for AeoLis input.

meteo.txt
---------

The meteo.txt file contains meteorological data used to simulate surface moisture in the model domain (see Simulation of surface moisture 
in Model description on for surface moisture implementation in AeoLiS).  This file is formatted similar to the other environmental boundary
condition files (wind, wave, and tide) such that it contains a time series of environmental data read into AeoLiS through keyword specification. 
The keywords required to process surface moisture with evaporation and infiltration are process_moist = True, method_moist_process = surf_moisture, 
th_moisture = True, and meteo_file = meteo.txt (or name of file containing meteorological data).  An example of the meteo.txt file can be seen in the 
figure below where each red dot represents a time series data value.  The first column contains time (s), the second column is temperature (degrees C),
the thrid column is precipitation (mm/hr), the fourth column is relative humidity (%), the fifth column is global radiation (MJ/$m^2$/day), and the sixth
column is air pressure (kPa).
