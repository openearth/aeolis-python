Tests
^^^^^^^

v2.0.0 (April 2022)
-------------------

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* New vegetation growth/expansion capabilities (Bart Van Westen)
* Addition of groundwater module and new moisture routines (Caroline Hallin)
* Incorporation of Okin (2008) vegetation shear coupler (Nick Cohn)
* Addition of Palmsten and Holman (2012) dune erosion module (Nick Cohn)
* Approach to add sand fences into model (Nick Cohn)

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Non-FFT 1D based topographic shear coupler added for computational speed up (Nick Cohn)


v1.2.2 (18 April 2020)
-----------------------

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Removed support for statistical variable names with dot-notation
  (e.g. `.avg` and `.sum`) (Bas Hoonhout)



Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Logger shows minute by minute updates (Tom Pak) 

New functions/methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Avalanching process included in bed.py (Tom Pak)
* Implementation of non-erodible layers (Tom Pak)

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* boundary condition definition updated (Tom Pak)
* compatiblity with new NETCDF4 version restored (Sierd de Vries)
* compatiblity with 1D domains (Sierd de Vries)

Tests
^^^^^

None.

v1.1.5 (unreleased)
-------------------

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

None.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Also enable inundation if process_tide is True, but tide_file not
  specified. In this case the water level is constant zero.

* Changed class attributes into instance attributes to support
  parallel independent model instances.

New functions/methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

None.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed double definition of statistics variables in netCDF file in
  case both `output_types` is specified and individual statistics
  variables are specified in `output_vars`.

Tests
^^^^^

None.

v1.1.4 (15 February 2018)
-------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Route all log messages and exceptions through the logging
  module. Consequently, all information, warnings, and exceptions,
  including tracebacks can be logged to file.

* Added model version number and Git hash to log files and model
  output.

v1.1.3 (9 February 2018)
------------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Apply precipitation/eaporation only in top bed layer to prevent
  mismatching matrix shapes in the multiplication. In the future,
  precipitation might be distributed over multiple layers depending on
  the porosity.

v1.1.2 (21 December 2017)
-------------------------

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Changed name of statistics variables that describe the average,
  minimum, maximum, cumulative values, or variance of a model state
  variable. The variables names that used to end with `.avg`, `.sum`,
  etc. now end with `_avg`, `_sum`, etc. The new naming convention was
  already adopted in the netCDF output in order to be compatible with
  the CF-1.6 convention, but is now also adopted in, for example, the
  Basic Model Interface (BMI). Old notation is deprecated but still
  supported.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Prepared for continuous integration through CircleCI.
* Prepared for code coverage checking through codecov.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Use percentages (0-100) rather than fractions (0-1) in the
  formulation of Belly and Johnson that describes the effect of soil
  moisture on the shear velocity threshold. Thanks to Dano Roelvink
  and Susana Costas (b3d992b).

Tests
^^^^^

* Reduced required accuracy for mass conservation tests from
  0.00000000000001% to 1%.

v1.1.1 (15 November 2017)
-------------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Made code compatible with Python 3.x.
* Prepared and uploaded package to PyPI.
* Switch back to original working directory after finishing
  simulation.
* Removed double definition of model state. Now only defined in
  `constants.MODEL_STATE`.
* Also write initial model state to output.
* Made netCDF output compatible with CF-1.6 convention.

New functions/methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added support to run a default model for testing purposes by setting
  the configuration file as "DEFAULT".
* Added generic framework for reading and applying spatial
  masks. Implemented support for wave, tide and threshold masks
  specifically.
* Added option to include a reference date in netCDF output.
* Added experimental option for constant boundary conditions.
* Added support for reading and writing hotstart files to load a
  (partial) model state upon initialisation.
* Added preliminary wind shear perturbation module. Untested.
* Added support to switch on or off specific processes.
* Added support for immutable model state variables. This
  functionality can be combined with BMI or hotstart files to prevent
  external process results to be overwritten by the model.
* Added option to specify wind direction convention (nautical or
  cartesian).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed conversion from volume to mass using porosity and density (fe9aa52).
* Update water level with bed updates to prevent loss of water due to
  bed level change (fe9aa52).
* Fixed mass bug in base layer that drained sediment from bottom
  layers, resulting in empty layers (f612760).
* Made removal of negative concentrations mass conserving by scraping
  the concentrations from all other grid cells (03de813).

Tests
^^^^^

* Added tests to check mass conservation in bed mixing routines.
* Added integration tests.

v1.1.0 (27 July 2016)
