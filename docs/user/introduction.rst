Introduction
============
AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment transport and morphological evolution in situations where supply-limiting factors are important,
like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported are soil moisture contents, sediment sorting and armouring, bed slope effects, air humidity and roughness elements. AeoLiS includes a dynamic vegetation module that simulates the interaction between sediment transport and vegetation dynamics.
