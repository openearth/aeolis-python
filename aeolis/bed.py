def prevent_negative_mass(m, dm, pickup):
    '''Handle situations in which negative mass may occur due to numerics

    Negative mass may occur by moving sediment to lower layers down to
    accomodate deposition of sediments. In particular two cases are
    important:

    #. A net deposition cell has some erosional fractions.

       In this case the top layer mass is reduced according to the
       existing sediment distribution in the layer to accomodate
       deposition of fresh sediment. If the erosional fraction is
       subtracted afterwards, negative values may occur. Therefore the
       erosional fractions are subtracted from the top layer
       beforehand in this function. An equal mass of deposition
       fractions is added to the top layer in order to keep the total
       layer mass constant. Subsequently, the distribution of the
       sediment to be moved to lower layers is determined and the
       remaining deposits are accomodated.

    #. Deposition is larger than the total mass in a layer.

       In this case a non-uniform distribution in the bed may also
       lead to negative values as the abundant fractions are reduced
       disproportionally as sediment is moved to lower layers to
       accomodate the deposits. This function fills the top layers
       entirely with fresh deposits and moves the existing sediment
       down such that the remaining deposits have a total mass less
       than the total bed layer mass. Only the remaining deposits are
       fed to the routine that moves sediment through the layers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : np.ndarray
        Sediment mass in bed (nx*ny, nl, nf)
    dm : np.ndarray
        Total sediment mass exchanged between layers (nx*ny, nf)
    pickup : np.ndarray
        Sediment pickup (nx*ny, nf)

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Sediment mass in bed (nx*ny, nl, nf)
    np.ndarray
        Total sediment mass exchanged between layers (nx*ny, nf)
    np.ndarray
        Sediment pickup (nx*ny, nf)

    Note
    ----
    The situations handled in this function can also be prevented by
    reducing the time step, increasing the layer mass or increasing
    the adaptation time scale.
