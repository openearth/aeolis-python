"""
This is a blackbox (regression) test for the AeoLiS model. It tests whether the
model produces a netCDF file and a log file upon the completion of the
simulation.

The test inputs used by the test are stored in the inputs/ directory. The test
inputs are organized in subdirectories based on the dimension of the model.
Each dimension has a list of test cases, each of which is a directory that
contains an input model configuration file.

test_netCDF_file_creation() is the main test function that contains the test logic.

path_test_input() is a helper function that does the preparation work needed
by test_netCDF_file_creation().

    This function requires the path to the test input directory as a

    that is marked as a fixture for this test. When pytest executes this test,
    it detects path_test_input() mentioned as a fixture, and executes it before
    executing this function. The return value of path_test_input() is passed as
    an argument to this function.

    path_test_input : str
